# Malaria Detection

The data is taken from Kaggle's [Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).

This project uses a transferred learning model built on vgg16 to identify cell images infected by malaria. The tailored model has an over 95% accuracy rate.
